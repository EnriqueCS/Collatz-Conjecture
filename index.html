    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      I’m exploring the Collatz Conjecture out of curiosity and boredom. Some equations might be incorrect, but it’s a fun exercise. I’m also creating a digital backup of my notes, usually written in a physical notebook, by transferring them into LaTeX and publishing via GitHub Pages. This ensures I don’t lose my work. For simplicity, I’m using a single <code>index.html</code> file with MathJax—no frameworks, just basic HTML. If you’re reading this, you’re probably as bored as I am. — Jose Alvarez &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Last Updated: 03/16/2025)

<h2>Proving \( E_0 \twoheadrightarrow_k O_0 \)</h2>

<p>Generalized rule for powers of 2 in terms of \( k_3 \):</p>
<ul>
    <li>For even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 1 \in A_1 \).</li>
    <li>For odd powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3+1} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 2 \in A_2 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since in the Collatz conjecture we eventually reach \( f^K(x) = 1 \), we can work our way backwards using the \( \twoheadrightarrow \) operation. Consequently, any number that is a power of 2 will ultimately lead to 1 because of the effect of the \( \twoheadrightarrow \) operation.</p>
<p>Because of the previous statement, we can create \( S_1 \), which is for even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), and is a strict subset of \( E_1 \subset A_1 \). Similarly, we define \( S_2 \), which has the same relationship but with odd powers of 2, and the union of \( S_1 \cup S_2 \) produces \( S \), the 'end set.' Therefore, two sequences of actions (denoted by \( \Rrightarrow_k \)) can be made:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      E \twoheadrightarrow_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(first sequence starting with \( x \in E \))}
  \]

  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(second sequence starting with \( O \))}
  \]
</p>

<p>The \( \twoheadrightarrow \) action is stackable, meaning that an even number divided by 2 can lead to another even number. Specifically:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow_2 \twoheadrightarrow_2 = \twoheadrightarrow_4
  \]
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow_m \twoheadrightarrow_n = \twoheadrightarrow_{m+n}
  \]
</p>

<p>It’s important to note that \( \twoheadrightarrow \) followed by \( \twoheadrightarrow \) is not multiplication; instead, it is equivalent to function composition, meaning:</p>

<p>
  \[
  f \circ g(x) = f(g(x))
  \]
</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that since we defined \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \), it means that this action applies \( k \) times. However, it does not specify whether the remaining value is even or odd. On the other hand, \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_k \) states that the operation was applied \( k \) times, where the final result is odd. This can be expressed as:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow_k \quad \text{(applies \( k \) times without specifying even or odd)}
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_k \quad \text{(applies \( k \) times with the final result being odd)}
  \]
</p>

<p>For the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation, which applies to odd numbers, we have:</p>

<p>
  Let \( x = 2k_1 + 1 \), where \( k_1 \) is an integer. Applying \( \rightarrowtail(x) = 3x + 1 \) gives:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \rightarrowtail(x) = 3(2k_1 + 1) + 1 = 6k_1 + 4 = 2(3k_1 + 2).
  \]
</p>

<p>Since \( 2(3k_1 + 2) \) is clearly even, the result of \( \rightarrowtail \) is always even. Therefore, the operation cannot be stacked because it is only defined for odd numbers.</p>

<p>
  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      E \twoheadrightarrow_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\  
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(first sequence starting with \( x \in E \))}
  \]

  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2} \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\  
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(second sequence expanded, where \( E' \) is the even result of \( \rightarrowtail \))}
  \]
</p>

<p>
Since the first case is a subsequence of the second case, we can generalize the analysis by focusing on the second case. Both sequences share the same structure after reaching \( E' \), meaning we only need to study the general form:
</p>

\[
O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2} \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1
\]

<p>
By doing so, we encompass all cases while maintaining the same transformation rules.
</p>

<p>
  Now, let us refine \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \) by introducing \( \twoheadrightarrow_k^{(O)} \), which explicitly denotes that the final outcome is odd. This adjustment makes the transition structure more explicit and systematic:
  </p>
  
  \[
  O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

\[
  O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

\[
  O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S^{(m-1)} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

<p>  
Since \( O' \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S^{(m-1)} \) maps odd numbers to even numbers, the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation alone achieves this. However, another valid transformation sequence is:  
</p>  

\[
\rightarrowtail \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \dots \rightarrowtail (\twoheadrightarrow \rightarrowtail )_L
\]  

<p>  
This notation captures alternating applications of \( \rightarrowtail \) and \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \), maintaining the transition from odd to even until reaching \( S^{(m-1)} \).  
</p>

<p>Note: \( L \) can be \( 0 \).</p>

\[
O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \rightarrowtail_{k_3} (\twoheadrightarrow \rightarrowtail )_L S^{(3 + 2L)} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

<p>We can further reduce the sequence \( E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \rightarrowtail_{k_3} \) by incorporating it into the \( L \)-term. For example, considering that: </p>

<p>
  \[
  21 = 3 \times 7
  \]
  and
  \[
  21 = 2k + 1,
  \]
  we conclude that it falls under \( O_0 \). Furthermore, since:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  21 \times 3 + 1 = 64 \quad \text{and} \quad 64 = 2^6,
  \]
  we see that only the combination of \( \rightarrowtail_{} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} \) was necessary to reach \( 1 \). Thus, we can lump the \( k_2 \) and \( k_3 \) actions into the set \( S \), resulting in:
</p>

\[
O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' (\twoheadrightarrow \rightarrowtail )_L S^{(2L + 1)} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

\[
(\rightarrowtail)_O (\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail )_{L + O} \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_{L + O + N} 1
\]

<p>Remember that for \( (\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail)_{L + O} \), each \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \) is associated with \( n_1, n_2, \dots, n_l \) because these represent the steps required to become odd. Therefore, \( L \) should be the sum of the following:</p>

<p>
  \[
  L = \sum_{i=1}^{l} (n_i + 1)
  \]
  where each \( (n_i + 1) \) represents the number of steps needed to transition from odd to even in the sequence, followed by a \( \rightarrowtail \) step.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, we define \( K \) as follows:
  \[
  K = L + O + N
  \]
  where:
  <ul>
    <li> \( L \) is the sum of the steps required to transition from odd to even,</li>
    <li> \( O \) is 1 if the process started with an odd number and 0 otherwise,</li>
    <li> \( N \) represents the number of steps taken to reach \( 2^N \) (the power of 2 stage).</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Since we previously established that \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k A_1 \), we now only need to work with the four sets \( E_1 \), \( E_2 \), \( O_1 \), and \( O_2 \) (or equivalently \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \)) to cover all \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \).
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, because \( 3(O_2) + 1 \) falls in \( A_1 \), and since \( O_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), it specifically falls within \( E_1 \) due to the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation. Thus, we further reduce our sets.
</p>

<p>
  To show that \( O_1 \) falls inside \( E_1 \) due to the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation, consider that for any odd number \( x \in O_1 \), the operation \( \rightarrowtail \) is defined as \( 3x + 1 \). This operation always results in an even number, which must therefore belong to \( E_1 \) since \( E_1 \) contains even numbers. Hence, for any \( x \in O_1 \), \( \rightarrowtail(x) \in E_1 \), proving that \( O_1 \) is mapped into \( E_1 \) under the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation.
</p>

\[
(\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail )_{L} \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_{L + N} 1
\]

<p>
  Now, we are primarily concerned with the even sets \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \). Since \( S \) represents the end set and has already been solved, we now focus on the elements within \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that contain one additional prime factor beyond 2.
</p>

<p>
  Consider \( E_2 \). If an element is already in the \( S \) set, we don't need to worry about it, as it has already been solved. Otherwise, there remains only one path to follow whenever the sequence \( (\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail )_L \) exists. Since the last operation in this sequence is \( \rightarrowtail \), it is guaranteed to result in an element from \( A_1 \), and since it is even result, it falls under \( E_1 \). This allows us to reduce the problem to just the subset of \( E_1 \).
</p>

<p>
  We can now represent the sequence as:
  \[
  \left( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L} \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_{L + N} 1
  \]
  The use of brackets indicates that the sequence is guaranteed to occur at least once, as the alternative is that the element already belongs to the end set \( S \).
</p>

<p>
  Using the fact that the sequence is a result of \( \rightarrowtail \) in the 
  \[
    \left( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L},
  \]
  we can conclude that the result is in \( A_1 \). 
  Moreover, based on the previous statement:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 1 \in A_1 \).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus, we have 
  \[
    \left( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L} = 2^{(N = 2n)} = 4^n.
  \]
</p>

<p> For the following operation, it is closed, meaning that it sends \( E_1 \) into \( E_1 \) indefinitely. </p>

<p>We partition \( E_1 \) into three subsets satisfying:</p>
<ul>
<li> \( 2k_1 \) (even numbers)</li>
<li> \( 3k_2 + 1 \) (\(\equiv 1 \mod 3\))</li>
</ul>

<p>Given \( x \in \{4, 10, 16\} \), we check:</p>
<ul>
<li> \( x \equiv 1 \mod 3 \) </li>
<li> \( x \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the valid partition:</p>

\[
E_1^{(1)} = \{18J + 4\}, \quad
E_1^{(2)} = \{18J + 10\}, \quad
E_1^{(3)} = \{18J + 16\}
\]

<p>For \( n = 18J + x \) where \( x \in \{4, 10, 16\} \):</p>

<ul>
  <li>\( 18J + 4 \twoheadrightarrow 9J + 2 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 1 \) (odd)</li>
  <li>\( 18J + 10 \twoheadrightarrow 9J + 5 \) (odd)</li>
  <li>\( 18J + 16 \twoheadrightarrow 9J + 8 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 4 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 2 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 1 \) (odd)</li>
</ul>

\[
\left( \twoheadrightarrow \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L}
\]

<ul>
  <li>\( 9J + 2 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 1 \) (odd)</li>
  <li>\( 9J + 5 \) (odd)</li>
  <li>\( 9J + 8 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 4 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 2 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 1 \) (odd)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, under \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \), all elements eventually reach:</p>

\[
\{9J + 1, 9J + 5\}
\]
