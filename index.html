    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        I'm doing this mostly out of boredom. The Collatz Conjecture is an interesting problem, and while some of the equations I write might be incorrect, I think it's fun to explore it. There’s no real goal here—just a curiosity-driven exercise.
        Another reason I'm writing this is to have a digital backup. I usually jot down notes in a physical notebook, but in case I lose it, I want to transfer my work into LaTeX and publish it using GitHub Pages. This way, I can always refer back to my notes without worrying about losing them.
        To keep things simple, I’m just using a single <code>index.html</code> file with MathJax for rendering LaTeX. No fancy frameworks, no complex setups—just a basic HTML page that serves my purpose.
        If you're reading this, you're probably as bored as I am. - Jose Alvarez

    <h2>Collatz Conjecture</h2>
    <p>
      The Collatz function is defined as:
      \[
      f(n) =
      \begin{cases} 
      \frac{n}{2}, & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
      3n + 1, & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
      \end{cases}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The conjecture states that for all \( n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), there exists some \( k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \) such that:
        \[
        f^K(n) = 1
        \]
    </p>

    <h2>03/09/2025 - Partitioning \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \)</h2>
    <p>Let us define \( A_0, A_1, A_2 \) for each of these sets in set-builder notation, where \( k \) is a positive integer. We can divide \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \) into three disjoint sets:</p>

<p>
\[
A_0 = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \mid x = 3k, \, k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \}
\]
\[
A_1 = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \mid x = 3k+1, \, k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \}
\]
\[
A_2 = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \mid x = 3k+2, \, k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \}
\]
</p>

<p>Each integer belongs to exactly one of these sets, forming a complete partition of \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \).</p>

<p>Let us now introduce \( E_0 \) and \( O_0 \), where both sets union together to form \( A_0 \), representing the even and odd integers of \( A_0 \), respectively. These sets do not share any elements. Similarly, such sets exist for \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \), and they are subsets of \( E^+ \) (all even numbers in \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \)) and \( O^+ \) (all odd numbers in \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \)), respectively. The relationships between these sets can be shown in set notation as follows:</p>

<p>
\[
A_0 = E_0 \cup O_0, \quad E_0 \cap O_0 = \emptyset
\]
\[
A_1 = E_1 \cup O_1, \quad E_1 \cap O_1 = \emptyset
\]
\[
A_2 = E_2 \cup O_2, \quad E_2 \cap O_2 = \emptyset
\]

<p>It follows that the union of \( E_0, E_1, E_2 \) and \( O_0, O_1, O_2 \) makes up \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \), as shown below:</p>

<p>
\[
\left( E_0 \cup E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \cup \left( O_0 \cup O_1 \cup O_2 \right) = \mathbb{Z}^+
\]
</p>

<p>Now, for these six sets \( E_0, E_1, E_2, O_0, O_1, O_2 \), we will show the properties of each element \( x \) using \( k_1 \) to show the parity equation and \( k_2 \) to show the \( 3k + z \) property. The relationships are as follows:</p>

<h2>Finding 'Paths'</h2>
<p>Let us define the following operations for any \( n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \):</p>

<p>
\[
n \xrightarrow{\rightarrowtail} 3n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\]
\[
n \xrightarrow{\twoheadrightarrow} \frac{n}{2} \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}
\]
</p>

<p>Furthermore, \( \Rrightarrow_k \) denotes the general action applied \( k \) times, where \( k \) is a positive integer. It can represent either \( \rightarrowtail \) or \( \twoheadrightarrow \), depending on the parity of the value in question.</p>

<p>To establish the existence of a positive integer \( k \) such that \( f^K(n) = 1 \), it is necessary to demonstrate a "path" from the initial value \( n \) to 1. This path is formed by successive applications of \( \Rrightarrow \) within each of the six sets that partition \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \).</p>

<h2>Proving \( E_0 \twoheadrightarrow_k O_0 \)</h2>
<p>Let \( n \in E_0 \subseteq A_0 \), so \( n \) is even. By the properties of \( E_0 \), we know that \( n = 2k_1 \) and \( n = 3k_2 \) for some \( k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \). By the definition of the operation \( \twoheadrightarrow \), we have:</p>

<p>
\[
n \twoheadrightarrow \frac{n}{2} \quad \text{(since \( n \) is even)}
\]
</p>

<p>We continue applying \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \) iteratively to reduce \( n \) within \( A_0 \), preserving the form \( n = 2k_1 \), until we reach an odd value \( m \). For \( m \), the property \( m = 2k_1 + 1 \) holds, and we know that \( m = 3k_2 \) for some \( k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), which satisfies the properties of \( O_0 \). Thus, \( n \Rrightarrow_k m \) for some \( k \) such that \( m \in O_0 \). Therefore, \( E_0 \Rrightarrow_k O_0 \) within \( A_0 \), completing the proof.</p>

<h2>Proving \( O_0 \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \)</h2>
<p>Let \( n \in O_0 \subseteq A_0 \), so \( n \) is odd. By the properties of \( O_0 \), we know that \( n = 2k_1 + 1 \) and \( n = 3k_2 \) for some \( k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \). By the definition of the operation \( \rightarrowtail \), we have:</p>

<p>
\[
n \rightarrowtail 3n + 1 \quad \text{(since \( n \) is odd)}
\]
</p>

<p>Applying \( \rightarrowtail \) to \( n \) once, we get:</p>

<p>
\[
n \rightarrowtail 3n + 1 = 3(2k_1 + 1) + 1 = 6k_1 + 4
\]
</p>

<p>We observe that \( 6k_1 + 4 \) is even, and thus belongs to \( E_1 \), which is the set of even numbers of the form \( x = 2k_1 \land x = 3k_2 + 1 \). Therefore, \( n \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \) and we conclude that \( O_0 \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \), completing the proof.</p>

<h2>Proving \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k A_1 \) or specifically \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k E_1 \)</h2>
<p>From the previous results, we have shown the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> \( E_0 \twoheadrightarrow_k O_0 \), meaning that starting from an element in \( E_0 \), we can reach an element in \( O_0 \) through a series of operations.</li>
  <li> \( O_0 \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \), meaning that starting from an element in \( O_0 \), applying the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation once leads to an element in \( E_1 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, combining these two results, we can conclude that an element from \( A_0 \) can be transformed into an element of \( E_1 \) as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Start with \( n \in E_0 \subseteq A_0 \), apply the \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \) operation, and we reach an element \( m \in O_0 \).</li>
  <li> From \( m \in O_0 \), applying the \( \rightarrowtail_1 \) operation leads to an element in \( E_1 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, \( A_0 \rightarrow E_1 \) is demonstrated, completing the proof.</p>

<p>Generalized rule for powers of 2 in terms of \( k_3 \):</p>
<ul>
    <li>For even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 1 \in A_1 \).</li>
    <li>For odd powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3+1} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 2 \in A_2 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since in the Collatz conjecture we eventually reach \( f^K(x) = 1 \), we can work our way backwards using the \( \twoheadrightarrow \) operation. Consequently, any number that is a power of 2 will ultimately lead to 1 because of the effect of the \( \twoheadrightarrow \) operation.</p>
<p>Because of the previous statement, we can create \( S_1 \), which is for even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), and is a strict subset of \( E_1 \subset A_1 \). Similarly, we define \( S_2 \), which has the same relationship but with odd powers of 2, and the union of \( S_1 \cup S_2 \) produces \( S \), the 'end set.' Therefore, two sequences of actions (denoted by \( \Rrightarrow_k \)) can be made:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      E \twoheadrightarrow_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(first sequence starting with \( x \in E \))}
  \]

  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(second sequence starting with \( O \))}
  \]
</p>

<p>Since we previously established that \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k A_1 \), we now only need to work with the four sets \( E_1 \), \( E_2 \), \( O_1 \), and \( O_2 \) (or equivalently \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \)) to cover all \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \).</p>
