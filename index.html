    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        I'm doing this mostly out of boredom. The Collatz Conjecture is an interesting problem, and while some of the equations I write might be incorrect, I think it's fun to explore it. There’s no real goal here—just a curiosity-driven exercise.
        Another reason I'm writing this is to have a digital backup. I usually jot down notes in a physical notebook, but in case I lose it, I want to transfer my work into LaTeX and publish it using GitHub Pages. This way, I can always refer back to my notes without worrying about losing them.
        To keep things simple, I’m just using a single <code>index.html</code> file with MathJax for rendering LaTeX. No fancy frameworks, no complex setups—just a basic HTML page that serves my purpose.
        If you're reading this, you're probably as bored as I am. - Jose Alvarez &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Last Updated: 03/13/2025)

    <h2>Collatz Conjecture</h2>

<p>
    For all \( n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), \( \exists K \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \) such that \( f^K(n) = 1 \). Where:
</p>

\[
f(n) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{n}{2}, & n \text{ even} \\
3n + 1, & n \text{ odd}
\end{cases}
\]

<h2>Partitioning \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \)</h2>
<p>
  Let \( i \in \{ 0, 1, 2 \} \). This is the beginning of our attempt to solve the conjecture by partitioning \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \) into three disjoint sets:
</p>

\[
\mathbb{Z}^+ = A_0 \sqcup A_1 \sqcup A_2
\]

\[
A_i = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \mid x \equiv i \, (\text{mod} \, 3) \}
\]

<p>
  Introducing \( E, O \) such that \( A_i = E_i \cup O_i \) with \( E_i \cap O_i = \emptyset \), we define:
</p>

\[
E_i = \{ x \in A_i \mid x \text{ is even} \}, \quad O_i = \{ x \in A_i \mid x \text{ is odd} \}
\]

\[
A_i = E_i \cup O_i, \quad E_i \cap O_i = \emptyset
\]

\[
\left( E_0 \cup E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \cup \left( O_0 \cup O_1 \cup O_2 \right) = \mathbb{Z}^+
\]

<h2>Defining 'Actions'</h2>
<p>For any \( n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), define the following operations:</p>

<p>
\[
n \xrightarrow{\rightarrowtail} 3n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \quad n \xrightarrow{\twoheadrightarrow} \frac{n}{2} \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}
\]
</p>

<p>Let \( \Rrightarrow_K \) represent the action applied \( K \) times, where \( K \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \). It can be either \( \rightarrowtail \) or \( \twoheadrightarrow \), depending on whether \( n \) is odd or even:</p>

\[
\Rrightarrow_K(n) = \begin{cases} 
3n + 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
\frac{n}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
\end{cases}
\]

<p>To prove the existence of a positive integer \( K \) such that \( f^K(n) = 1 \), we must show a "path" from \( n \) to 1, formed by successive applications of \( \Rrightarrow \) within the six sets partitioning \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \).</p>

<h2>Proving \( E_0 \twoheadrightarrow_k O_0 \)</h2>
<p>Let \( n \in E_0 \subseteq A_0 \), so \( n \) is even. By the properties of \( E_0 \), we know that \( n = 2k_1 \) and \( n = 3k_2 \) for some \( k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \). By the definition of the operation \( \twoheadrightarrow \), we have:</p>

<p>
\[
n \twoheadrightarrow \frac{n}{2} \quad \text{(since \( n \) is even)}
\]
</p>

<p>We continue applying \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \) iteratively to reduce \( n \) within \( A_0 \), preserving the form \( n = 2k_1 \), until we reach an odd value \( m \). For \( m \), the property \( m = 2k_1 + 1 \) holds, and we know that \( m = 3k_2 \) for some \( k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), which satisfies the properties of \( O_0 \). Thus, \( n \Rrightarrow_k m \) for some \( k \) such that \( m \in O_0 \). Therefore, \( E_0 \Rrightarrow_k O_0 \) within \( A_0 \), completing the proof.</p>

<h2>Proving \( O_0 \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \)</h2>
<p>Let \( n \in O_0 \subseteq A_0 \), so \( n \) is odd. By the properties of \( O_0 \), we know that \( n = 2k_1 + 1 \) and \( n = 3k_2 \) for some \( k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \). By the definition of the operation \( \rightarrowtail \), we have:</p>

<p>
\[
n \rightarrowtail 3n + 1 \quad \text{(since \( n \) is odd)}
\]
</p>

<p>Applying \( \rightarrowtail \) to \( n \) once, we get:</p>

<p>
\[
n \rightarrowtail 3n + 1 = 3(2k_1 + 1) + 1 = 6k_1 + 4
\]
</p>

<p>We observe that \( 6k_1 + 4 \) is even, and thus belongs to \( E_1 \), which is the set of even numbers of the form \( x = 2k_1 \land x = 3k_2 + 1 \). Therefore, \( n \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \) and we conclude that \( O_0 \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \), completing the proof.</p>

<h2>Proving \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k A_1 \) or specifically \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k E_1 \)</h2>
<p>From the previous results, we have shown the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> \( E_0 \twoheadrightarrow_k O_0 \), meaning that starting from an element in \( E_0 \), we can reach an element in \( O_0 \) through a series of operations.</li>
  <li> \( O_0 \rightarrowtail_1 E_1 \), meaning that starting from an element in \( O_0 \), applying the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation once leads to an element in \( E_1 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, combining these two results, we can conclude that an element from \( A_0 \) can be transformed into an element of \( E_1 \) as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Start with \( n \in E_0 \subseteq A_0 \), apply the \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \) operation, and we reach an element \( m \in O_0 \).</li>
  <li> From \( m \in O_0 \), applying the \( \rightarrowtail_1 \) operation leads to an element in \( E_1 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, \( A_0 \rightarrow E_1 \) is demonstrated, completing the proof.</p>

<p>Generalized rule for powers of 2 in terms of \( k_3 \):</p>
<ul>
    <li>For even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 1 \in A_1 \).</li>
    <li>For odd powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3+1} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 2 \in A_2 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since in the Collatz conjecture we eventually reach \( f^K(x) = 1 \), we can work our way backwards using the \( \twoheadrightarrow \) operation. Consequently, any number that is a power of 2 will ultimately lead to 1 because of the effect of the \( \twoheadrightarrow \) operation.</p>
<p>Because of the previous statement, we can create \( S_1 \), which is for even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), and is a strict subset of \( E_1 \subset A_1 \). Similarly, we define \( S_2 \), which has the same relationship but with odd powers of 2, and the union of \( S_1 \cup S_2 \) produces \( S \), the 'end set.' Therefore, two sequences of actions (denoted by \( \Rrightarrow_k \)) can be made:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      E \twoheadrightarrow_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(first sequence starting with \( x \in E \))}
  \]

  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(second sequence starting with \( O \))}
  \]
</p>

<p>The \( \twoheadrightarrow \) action is stackable, meaning that an even number divided by 2 can lead to another even number. Specifically:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow_2 \twoheadrightarrow_2 = \twoheadrightarrow_4
  \]
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow_m \twoheadrightarrow_n = \twoheadrightarrow_{m+n}
  \]
</p>

<p>It’s important to note that \( \twoheadrightarrow \) followed by \( \twoheadrightarrow \) is not multiplication; instead, it is equivalent to function composition, meaning:</p>

<p>
  \[
  f \circ g(x) = f(g(x))
  \]
</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that since we defined \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \), it means that this action applies \( k \) times. However, it does not specify whether the remaining value is even or odd. On the other hand, \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_k \) states that the operation was applied \( k \) times, where the final result is odd. This can be expressed as:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow_k \quad \text{(applies \( k \) times without specifying even or odd)}
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_k \quad \text{(applies \( k \) times with the final result being odd)}
  \]
</p>

<p>For the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation, which applies to odd numbers, we have:</p>

<p>
  Let \( x = 2k_1 + 1 \), where \( k_1 \) is an integer. Applying \( \rightarrowtail(x) = 3x + 1 \) gives:</p>

<p>
  \[
  \rightarrowtail(x) = 3(2k_1 + 1) + 1 = 6k_1 + 4 = 2(3k_1 + 2).
  \]
</p>

<p>Since \( 2(3k_1 + 2) \) is clearly even, the result of \( \rightarrowtail \) is always even. Therefore, the operation cannot be stacked because it is only defined for odd numbers.</p>

<p>
  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      E \twoheadrightarrow_{k_1} \Rrightarrow_{k_2} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\  
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(first sequence starting with \( x \in E \))}
  \]

  \[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2} \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1 \\  
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \quad \text{(second sequence expanded, where \( E' \) is the even result of \( \rightarrowtail \))}
  \]
</p>

<p>
Since the first case is a subsequence of the second case, we can generalize the analysis by focusing on the second case. Both sequences share the same structure after reaching \( E' \), meaning we only need to study the general form:
</p>

\[
O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2} \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m} 1
\]

<p>
By doing so, we encompass all cases while maintaining the same transformation rules.
</p>

<p>
  Now, let us refine \( \twoheadrightarrow_k \) by introducing \( \twoheadrightarrow_k^{(O)} \), which explicitly denotes that the final outcome is odd. This adjustment makes the transition structure more explicit and systematic:
  </p>
  
  \[
  O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

\[
  O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

\[
  O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S^{(m-1)} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

<p>  
Since \( O' \Rrightarrow_{k_3} S^{(m-1)} \) maps odd numbers to even numbers, the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation alone achieves this. However, another valid transformation sequence is:  
</p>  

\[
\rightarrowtail \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \dots \rightarrowtail (\twoheadrightarrow \rightarrowtail )_L
\]  

<p>  
This notation captures alternating applications of \( \rightarrowtail \) and \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \), maintaining the transition from odd to even until reaching \( S^{(m-1)} \).  
</p>

<p>Note: \( L \) can be \( 0 \).</p>

\[
O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \rightarrowtail_{k_3} (\twoheadrightarrow \rightarrowtail )_L S^{(3 + 2L)} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

<p>We can further reduce the sequence \( E' \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} O' \rightarrowtail_{k_3} \) by incorporating it into the \( L \)-term. For example, considering that: </p>

<p>
  \[
  21 = 3 \times 7
  \]
  and
  \[
  21 = 2k + 1,
  \]
  we conclude that it falls under \( O_0 \). Furthermore, since:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  21 \times 3 + 1 = 64 \quad \text{and} \quad 64 = 2^6,
  \]
  we see that only the combination of \( \rightarrowtail_{} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_2}^{(O)} \) was necessary to reach \( 1 \). Thus, we can lump the \( k_2 \) and \( k_3 \) actions into the set \( S \), resulting in:
</p>

\[
O \rightarrowtail_{k_1} E' (\twoheadrightarrow \rightarrowtail )_L S^{(2L + 1)} \twoheadrightarrow_{k_m}^{(O)} 1
\]

\[
(\rightarrowtail)_O (\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail )_{L + O} \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_{L + O + N} 1
\]

<p>Remember that for \( (\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail)_{L + O} \), each \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \) is associated with \( n_1, n_2, \dots, n_l \) because these represent the steps required to become odd. Therefore, \( L \) should be the sum of the following:</p>

<p>
  \[
  L = \sum_{i=1}^{l} (n_i + 1)
  \]
  where each \( (n_i + 1) \) represents the number of steps needed to transition from odd to even in the sequence, followed by a \( \rightarrowtail \) step.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, we define \( K \) as follows:
  \[
  K = L + O + N
  \]
  where:
  <ul>
    <li> \( L \) is the sum of the steps required to transition from odd to even,</li>
    <li> \( O \) is 1 if the process started with an odd number and 0 otherwise,</li>
    <li> \( N \) represents the number of steps taken to reach \( 2^N \) (the power of 2 stage).</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Since we previously established that \( A_0 \Rrightarrow_k A_1 \), we now only need to work with the four sets \( E_1 \), \( E_2 \), \( O_1 \), and \( O_2 \) (or equivalently \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \)) to cover all \( \mathbb{Z}^+ \).
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, because \( 3(O_2) + 1 \) falls in \( A_1 \), and since \( O_2 \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), it specifically falls within \( E_1 \) due to the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation. Thus, we further reduce our sets.
</p>

<p>
  To show that \( O_1 \) falls inside \( E_1 \) due to the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation, consider that for any odd number \( x \in O_1 \), the operation \( \rightarrowtail \) is defined as \( 3x + 1 \). This operation always results in an even number, which must therefore belong to \( E_1 \) since \( E_1 \) contains even numbers. Hence, for any \( x \in O_1 \), \( \rightarrowtail(x) \in E_1 \), proving that \( O_1 \) is mapped into \( E_1 \) under the \( \rightarrowtail \) operation.
</p>

\[
(\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail )_{L} \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_{L + N} 1
\]

<p>
  Now, we are primarily concerned with the even sets \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \). Since \( S \) represents the end set and has already been solved, we now focus on the elements within \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that contain one additional prime factor beyond 2.
</p>

<p>
  Consider \( E_2 \). If an element is already in the \( S \) set, we don't need to worry about it, as it has already been solved. Otherwise, there remains only one path to follow whenever the sequence \( (\twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail )_L \) exists. Since the last operation in this sequence is \( \rightarrowtail \), it is guaranteed to result in an element from \( A_1 \), and since it is even result, it falls under \( E_1 \). This allows us to reduce the problem to just the subset of \( E_1 \).
</p>

<p>
  We can now represent the sequence as:
  \[
  \left( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L} \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)}_{L + N} 1
  \]
  The use of brackets indicates that the sequence is guaranteed to occur at least once, as the alternative is that the element already belongs to the end set \( S \).
</p>

<p>
  Using the fact that the sequence is a result of \( \rightarrowtail \) in the 
  \[
    \left( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L},
  \]
  we can conclude that the result is in \( A_1 \). 
  Moreover, based on the previous statement:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For even powers of 2 (\( 2^{2k_3} \)), the expression is of the form \( 3k_2 + 1 \in A_1 \).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus, we have 
  \[
    \left( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \rightarrowtail \right)_{L} = 2^{(N = 2n)} = 4^n.
  \]
</p>

<p> For the following operation, it is closed, meaning that it sends \( E_1 \) into \( E_1 \) indefinitely. </p>

<p>We partition \( E_1 \) into three subsets satisfying:</p>
<ul>
<li> \( 2k_1 \) (even numbers)</li>
<li> \( 3k_2 + 1 \) (\(\equiv 1 \mod 3\))</li>
</ul>

<p>Given \( x \in \{4, 10, 16\} \), we check:</p>
<ul>
<li> \( x \equiv 1 \mod 3 \) </li>
<li> \( x \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the valid partition:</p>

\[
E_1^{(1)} = \{18J + 4\}, \quad
E_1^{(2)} = \{18J + 10\}, \quad
E_1^{(3)} = \{18J + 16\}
\]

<p>For \( n = 18J + x \) where \( x \in \{4, 10, 16\} \):</p>

<ul>
    <li>\( 18J + 4 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 2 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 1 \) (odd)</li>
    <li>\( 18J + 10 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 5 \) (odd)</li>
    <li>\( 18J + 16 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 8 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 4 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 2 \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} 9J + 1 \) (odd)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, under \( \twoheadrightarrow^{(O)} \), all elements eventually reach:</p>

\[
\{9J + 1, 9J + 5\}
\]
